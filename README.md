# `Official website`

# Introduction:

www.cybervein.org is the official website dedicated to CyberVein and the most authoritative for global development. As a global brand image, it plays the role of external publicity and communication on the Internet. Any user can log on to the website to query CyberVein introduction, technology, applications, use  cases, partners, token, and other related information.

# Background:

The global version of the CyberVein official website is still being updated. The project has always maintained the goal of bringing long-term value to its global users, continuously improving the product system, laying a solid technical foundation, and continuing to promote network upgrades. The official website contains information of CyberVein’s technology, market, community, landing, etc., and will have information in different languages, about services, strategies, technologies, and tools.



# Development direction:
The official website needs more motion graphics, icons, pictures, and other design elements. It needs to continue to bring users a smoother interactive experience through the iteration of the project, and use the interactive and imaginative way of presentation to the audience. Therefore, it is necessary for contributors to optimize and render motion pictures based on the CyberVein Vi system, and provide relevant ideas and codes so that more users who want to know CyberVein can more directly obtain the information they want.
